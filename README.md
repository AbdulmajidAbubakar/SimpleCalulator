# Simple Calculator
Simple Calculator is a console application written in C# that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your local machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from here.

# Usage
Upon running the application, the user will be prompted to enter a simple mathematical expression such as 23+454-34+34*33/7. The calculator does not currently support parentheses or operator precedence (i.e., "PEMDAS" or "BODMAS" rules are not applied). Each operation is performed from left to right.

The result of the calculation will be printed to the console.

Example:

Input: 10+20*2

Output: Result is: 60

(Note: In this case, according to the rules of operator precedence, the correct result would be 50 (because multiplication should be performed before addition). However, because this calculator does not apply these rules, the result is 60.)
